# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

As a project grows, organize code by splitting it inot modules, then multiple files.

You can extract parts into separate craetes that become external dependencies.

# Definitions

**Packages**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
**Crates**: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
**Modules** and **Use**: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
**Paths**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.
